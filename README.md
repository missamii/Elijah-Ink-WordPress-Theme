WordPress Theme for Kyle Moore

Kyle is an upcoming Guitarist and Songwriter. He currently attending Georgia State University.
His current goal is to leverage his talents and skills in music to providing musical education to grade school students. During that time he also plans to realize his end goal in producing.

## Purpose
My client, Kyle required a theme that showcased not only where his next tour will be. But something that creatively relected him as a unique artist in the music industry.
